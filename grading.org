* Sample Assignment 1
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:  sample1
:END:

Run the propview evaluation by putting the cursor on the #+BEGIN line and press =~C-c C-c=. Check the  =~ID= property under the section heading to see how the  =~propview= is controlled to collect the data.

#+NAME: tab_evaluation_summary1
#+BEGIN: propview :id "sample1" :conds ((string= EVALUATION "true")) :cols (ITEM TOTAL POINTS)
| ITEM                    | TOTAL | POINTS |
|-------------------------+-------+--------|
| "Example Criterion 1.1" |    25 |     20 |
| "Example Criterion 1.2" |    25 |     20 |
|-------------------------+-------+--------|
|                         |    50 |     40 |
#+TBLFM: @>$>=vsum(@I..II)::@>$2=vsum(@I..II)
#+END

** Example Criterion 1.1
:PROPERTIES:
:evaluation: true
:points: 20
:total: 25
:END:

Check the properties drawer below the header to see the points and totals for that criterion.

I typically use these two subheadings for the sheet. A description with a generic explanation what we evaluated in that criterion and a feeback section with personalized feedback for the students based on how they performed.

*** Description
Explain how you e.g. would evaluate and grade the students' knowledge of the topic.

*** Feedback
The student demonstrated an excellent understanding of the topic.

** Example Criterion 1.2
:PROPERTIES:
:evaluation: true
:points: 20
:total: 25
:END:
The student demonstrated an excellent understanding of the topic.


* Sample Assignment 2
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:  sample2
:END:

Here another  =~ID= is used to separate the summary per assignment.

#+NAME: tab_evaluation_summary2
#+BEGIN: propview :id "sample2" :conds ((string= EVALUATION "true")) :cols (ITEM TOTAL POINTS)
| ITEM                    | TOTAL | POINTS |
|-------------------------+-------+--------|
| "Example Criterion 2.1" |    25 |     20 |
| "Example Criterion 2.2" |    25 |     20 |
|-------------------------+-------+--------|
|                         |    50 |     40 |
#+TBLFM: @>$>=vsum(@I..II)::@>$2=vsum(@I..II)
#+END

** Example Criterion 2.1
:PROPERTIES:
:evaluation: true
:points: 20
:total: 25
:END:

The student demonstrated an excellent understanding of the topic.

** Example Criterion 2.2
:PROPERTIES:
:evaluation: true
:points: 20
:total: 25
:END:
The student demonstrated an excellent understanding of the topic.
